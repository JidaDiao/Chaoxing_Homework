Kernel is rectangular but incorrectly oriented as (20,1) (-5 points, 10/15 for kernel). Dilation operation is correct (15/15). Only result image displayed, missing source image (-5 points, 5/10 for display). Cleanup included, no deduction. Question 2 (33/50): Image reading with 'cross.png' is likely correct assuming standard directory (10/10). Kernel is correct (5,5) cross-shaped (15/15). Opening operation is correct but followed by unnecessary dilation (-5 points, 10/15 for operation). Only result image displayed with correct title 'JXH', missing source image (-5 points, 5/10 for display). Cleanup included, no deduction."

        "scoring_criteria": "Question 1 (34/50): Image reading uses 'morph01.png', assuming it works in their environment, but path lacks specificity, partial credit (6/10). Kernel is rectangular but incorrectly oriented as (20,1) instead of (1,N) for horizontal lines (-5 points, 10/15 for kernel). Dilation operation is correct (15/15). Both images displayed with generic titles (8/10, slight deduction for lack of personalization). Cleanup included, no deduction. Question 2 (33/50): Image reading uses 'cross.png', likely correct assuming reference environment (8/10). Kernel is correctly cross-shaped (5,5) (15/15). Operation is incorrect; uses dilation and opening but only displays opening result, missing original image and including unnecessary dilation (-7 points, 8/15 for operation). Only one image displayed with 'WH' title, not clearly personalized, and missing original image (-5 points, 5/10 for display). Cleanup included, no deduction."

Kernel is rectangular (20,1), incorrect for cross-shaped structure required for intersection points (-10 points, 5/15 for kernel). Dilation operation used instead of opening, inappropriate for retaining intersection points (0/15). Both images displayed with generic titles (8/10, slight deduction for lack of personalization).
