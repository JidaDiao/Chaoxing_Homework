The rectangular kernel is partially correct, but it has an improper orientation (10,1) for horizontal lines, missing horizontal retention capability (-5 points, 10/15). Dilation operation is correctly implemented (15/15). Both images are displayed, but with incorrect titles (-5 points, 5/10 for display). Cleanup included, no deduction. Question 2 (31/50): Correct image reading (10/10). Cross-shaped kernel of (5,5) is accurately defined (15/15), and the correct opening operation is performed (15/15). Both images are displayed with one showing the student’s name in the title (10/10). However, the result image does not appear to retain intersections well (-5 points, 5/10 for result visualization). Cleanup included, no deduction. While郭捷瑞shows some understanding, there are improvements needed in kernel orientation and result interpretation for Question 1, and more effort needed in visualization for Question 2."

        "scoring_criteria": "**Question 1 (44/50):** Correct image reading (10/10). The rectangular kernel with size (20,1) is appropriate for retaining horizontal lines (15/15). The dilation operation is implemented correctly (15/15). Both images are displayed (10/10). **Question 2 (25/50):** Correct image reading (10/10). The cross-shaped kernel with size (5,5) is correctly chosen (15/15). However, two operations (dilation and opening) are applied separately, with the dilation step being redundant and implying unnecessary processing. Deduction applied for the extra dilation step (-5 points, 10/15 for operation). Opening operation is correctly executed, and both images are displayed with the student’s name in the title (10/10). Cleanup is included, so no deductions for missing `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`. **Overall:** While the implementation for Question 1 is accurate and complete, there is an unnecessary step in Question 2 which detracts slightly from the score."
