Total score: 100 points, 50 points per question. Question 1 (50 points): Correct image reading (10 points), appropriate rectangular kernel for horizontal lines (15 points, -5 for incorrect orientation like (N,1)), correct dilation (15 points), display both images (10 points, -5 for missing one). Deductions: -5 for missing cv2.destroyAllWindows(), -5 for non-standard kernel (e.g., np.ones). Question 2 (50 points): Correct image reading (10 points), appropriate cross-shaped kernel (15 points, -5 for non-standard kernel), correct opening operation (15 points, -5 for extra operations like dilation), display both images with studentâ€™s name (10 points, -5 for missing one or incorrect title). Deductions: -5 for missing cv2.destroyAllWindows(). Students often used incorrect kernel orientations in Q1 and added unnecessary dilation in Q2, reflecting moderate understanding. File path variations (e.g., 'sucai5/') were partially credited if filename was correct.
